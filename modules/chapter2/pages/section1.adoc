= Guided Exercise: Create a blueprint and image

Create a blueprint and its corresponding image by using the web console.

*Outcomes*

- Create a `blueprint` and the corresponding image by using the web console.
.. Install `osbuild-composer, composer-cli, cockpit-composer, bash-completion` and their dependencies on `workstation`.
.. Create a blueprint called composer-test on the workstation machine.
.. Add the bison package to the composer-test blueprint.
.. Create a tar image using the composer-test blueprint.

As the student user on the `workstation` machine, use the lab command to prepare your environment for this exercise, and to ensure that all required resources are available.
 
  [student@workstation ~]$ lab start imagebuilder-create

 Note: Image builder usually requires a subscription to work.
 The lab start script configures this lab in a way that you do not need a subscription (uses local dvd repos).
 In your own systems, you need to subscribe them to use image builder.
 For information on this workaround you can refer https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?Bugzilla_restrictlogin=on&id=1915351[RFE: be able to use composer without CDN connection]

*Instructions*

The lab start script installed the `osbuild-composer, composer-cli, cockpit-composer, bash-completion` packages and their dependencies on `workstation.lab.example.com`.

. Start and enable image builder and cockpit sockets.
   
   [student@workstation ~]$ sudo systemctl enable --now osbuild-composer.socket
   Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/sockets.target.wants/osbuild-composer.socket → /usr/lib/systemd/system/osbuild-composer.socket.

   [student@workstation ~]$ sudo systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket
   Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/sockets.target.wants/cockpit.socket → /usr/lib/systemd/system/cockpit.socket.

. Load the shell configuration script so that the autocomplete feature for the composer-cli command starts working immediately without reboot.
  
   [student@workstation ~]$ source /etc/bash_completion.d/composer-cli

. To run the `composer-cli` commands as a non-root user, the user must be in the `weld` or the root group.
.. To add the `student` user to the `weldr` or the `root` group, run the following commands.
... Enter the sudo password `student` when prompted.
     [student@workstation ~]$ sudo usermod -a -G weldr student
     [student@workstation ~]$ newgrp weldr

.. Check the sources configured for image builder.

    [student@workstation ~]$ composer-cli sources list
    appstream
    baseos
    [student@workstation ~]$ composer-cli sources info baseos
    check_gpg = false
    check_repogpg = false
    check_ssl = true
    gpgkeys = [...output omitted...]
    id = "baseos"
    name = "baseos"
    rhsm = false
    system = true
    type = "yum-baseurl"
    url = "http://content.example.com/rhel9.0/x86_64/dvd/BaseOS"

    [student@workstation ~]$ composer-cli sources info appstream
    ...output omitted...

... Notice the url field, it points to the dvd repo. In your own (external to this lab) system, after you subscribe the system and configure image builder, you see the url of Red Hat CDN.

. Access the image builder dashboard in the RHEL web console.
.. Visit the GNOME login screen on the `workstation` system. You can access the console under the *Lab Environment* tab of this ROLE course and then by clicking the *Open Console* button beside the workstation machine.
.. After the GNOME login screen is visible, click the `student` user account. Enter student when prompted for the password.
.. Navigate to https://localhost:9090/ in the Firefox browser on the `workstation` system to open the RHEL `web console`.

.. Proceed with the `self-signed` certificate by clicking on *Advanced…*​ and *Accept the Risk and Continue*.

.. The login page of the RHEL web console is now visible. Log in by using the username `student` and by entering the `student` password.

.. Click *Turn on administrative access*. Enter the password student when prompted and click *Authenticate*.

... Now you have administrative access on the `workstation` host.

. Click `Image Builder` in the left sidebar and then click *Create blueprint*.

. For the new blueprint name, use `composer-test`. The description is optional, but you can type something in that field, as shown here. After entering details click *Next*.
+

. Add the `bison` package to the `composer-test` blueprint.
.. With the new `blueprint` open, under `Available packages`, type `bison` in the filter by name box and press enter. Confirm the results are similar to what is shown here.
... It can take about 2-3 minutes for the search to complete.
+

.. Select the `bison` package from the search result.
+

.. Click > to add the selected bison package to Chosen packages.

.. Keep clicking *Next* until it reaches the Review section and then click *Save*.

... Alternatively, you can reduce the font size in the browser to see the options sidebar. Click Review to directly jump to the review section.
+

. Create a `tar` image using the `composer-test` blueprint.
.. With the `composer-test` blueprint still open, click *Create image*.
+

.. In the `Create image` dialog, select Disk Archive (``.tar`) as the Image output type and click *Next* to proceed.
+
image::8.2.png[float=center]

.. In Review section, click *Create*.
+

.. Verify that the image creation is added to queue. Click the `Images` tab to see the status.
+
image::8.4.png[float=center]

.. On the Images tab, verify the image output Type and image Status.

    Note: 
     Wait for the image to be created before continuing. This might take about 5 minutes to complete. To verify the status from a command line, switch to the terminal to the workstation machine and run composer-cli compose list command repeatedly:

     [student@workstation ~]$ composer-cli compose list
     ID                                     Status    Blueprint       Version   Type
     838abcf7-a455-4388-b51e-0fea3d406786   RUNNING   composer-test   0.0.0     tar

     [student@workstation ~]$ composer-cli compose list
     ID                                     Status     Blueprint       Version   Type
     838abcf7-a455-4388-b51e-0fea3d406786   FINISHED   composer-test   0.0.0     tar

     Verify that the status column changes from RUNNING to FINISHED.

.. Switch to the browser and refresh the web page.
... Click the `Images` tab to verify that the image status is `Ready`.

. Run the grading script to verify your work,

   [student@workstation ~]$ lab grade imagebuilder-create
    Grading lab.
    SUCCESS Checking lab systems
    ...output omitted...
    Overall lab grade: PASS

.. Do not delete the composer-test blueprint because you use it in a later exercise.
