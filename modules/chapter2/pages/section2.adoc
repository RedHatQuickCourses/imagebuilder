= Guided Exercise: Modify an existing blueprint and create another image 

Modify a blueprint by using the web console and create an image from the updated blueprint.

*Outcomes*

- Modify a blueprint by using the web console and create an image from the updated blueprint.
.. Open the `composer-test` blueprint for editing.
.. Remove the `bison` package.
.. Add these packages: `findutils, diffutils, pciutils`
.. Create a QEMU qcow2 Image (.qcow2) using the `composer-test` blueprint.

*Instructions*

. Edit the `composer-test` blueprint.
.. Access the image builder dashboard in the RHEL web console. Open https://localhost:9090/ in the Firefox browser on the `workstation` system.
.. If you are not already logged in, log in by using the username `student` and by entering the `student` password.

    Note: 
      Wait for the image creation to finish before proceeding, it takes about 5 minutes. To verify the status from a command line, switch to the Terminal and run the composer-cli compose list command repeatedly:

      [student@workstation ~]$ composer-cli compose list
      ID                                     Status     Blueprint       Version   Type
      d7c11834-cc76-474d-9ace-68a071cf89ff   RUNNING    composer-test   0.0.1     qcow2
      838abcf7-a455-4388-b51e-0fea3d406786   FINISHED   composer-test   0.0.0     tar

      [student@workstation ~]$ composer-cli compose list
      ID                                     Status     Blueprint       Version   Type
      838abcf7-a455-4388-b51e-0fea3d406786   FINISHED   composer-test   0.0.0     tar
      d7c11834-cc76-474d-9ace-68a071cf89ff   FINISHED   composer-test   0.0.1     qcow2

      Notice that the version has updated to 0.0.1 as you modified the existing blueprint.

.. Switch to the Firefox browser and refresh the web page. Click the Images tab and verify that the image status is Ready.

. Run the grading script to verify your work.
   [student@workstation ~]$ lab grade imagebuilder-modify
   Grading lab.
   SUCCESS Checking lab systems
   ...output omitted...
   Overall lab grade: PASS

. Optionally, download the `qcow2` image and create a VM.
.. When the image build is finished, the Download image button is enabled. Download the image by clicking *Download image* for the `qcow2` image. Choose Save File and click *OK*.

.. Switch to the terminal and list the downloaded image to confirm the download.
    
    [student@workstation ~]$ ls ~/Downloads/
    d7c11834-cc76-474d-9ace-68a071cf89ff-disk.qcow2

... The file name in the preceding output is different on your system.

.. Install the necessary packages to enable the workstation machine to host virtual machines. Enter `student` as the sudo password when prompted.
    [student@workstation ~]$ sudo yum install -y virt-manager libvirt libvirt-client qemu-kvm qemu-img virt-install virt-viewer
    [sudo] password for student:

.. Enable and start the `libvirtd` service.
   
   [student@workstation ~]$ sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd
   Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/libvirtd.service → /usr/lib/systemd/system/libvirtd.service.
   Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/sockets.target.wants/libvirtd.socket → /usr/lib/systemd/system/libvirtd.socket.
   Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/sockets.target.wants/libvirtd-ro.socket → /usr/lib/systemd/system/libvirtd-ro.socket.

.. Copy the downloaded image to the default pool.
   
    [student@workstation ~]$ sudo cp /home/student/Downloads/d7c11834-cc76-474d-9ace-68a071cf89ff-disk.qcow2 /var/lib/libvirt/images/

... In the preceding command, make sure to replace the file name as visible in your system.

.. Test the image using the following command. The commands creates a virtual machine with the name RHEL9Lab2.
    
    [student@workstation ~]$ sudo virt-install --name RHEL9Lab2 --memory 2048 --vcpus 2 --os-variant rhel9.0 --import --disk  /var/lib/libvirt/images/d7c11834-cc76-474d-9ace-68a071cf89ff-disk.qcow2
    ...output omitted...
    Starting install...
    Creating domain...

    Domain is still running. Installation may be in progress.
    Waiting for the installation to complete.

... You can use ctrl+c to quit out of the running command.

.. On the workstation GUI, search for Virtual Machine Manager.
