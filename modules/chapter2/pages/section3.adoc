= Guided Exercise: Customize a blueprint for post-installation tasks

Customize a blueprint by using the web console for post-installation tasks like adding users and SSH keys.

*Outcomes*

- Customize a blueprint by using the web console for post-installation tasks like adding users and SSH keys.
.. Save the `composer-test` blueprint using the composer-cli command.
.. Configure a new user `user1` with password `redhat`, and belongs to the `wheel` and `users` groups.
.. Configure an SSH key for the root user.
.. Push the modified composer-test blueprint, and confirm that your changes are applied.
.. Use the RHEL web console to create a QEMU qcow2 Image (`.qcow2`) using the customized blueprint.

The resulting image build should have user1 with sudo access (because of the wheel group), and it allows SSH for the root user with the correct key authentication.

*Instructions*

. Save a copy of the `composer-test` blueprint and copy it to a new file before customizing it.
.. Open a terminal to the workstation machine.
.. Use this command to save a copy of the blueprint configuration file.
 
    [student@workstation ~]$ composer-cli blueprints save composer-test

... The file itself is in the TOML format (.toml) and can be edited in any text editor.
   
    [student@workstation ~]$ ls
    composer-test.toml ...

    Note: 
        The name of the TOML file does not matter, it is optional that you rename the file to match the blueprint name.

.. Copy the file to the name `composer-test-new.toml`.

    [student@workstation ~]$ cp composer-test.toml composer-test-new.toml

. Edit the file `composer-test-new.toml` in a local text editor to customize the blueprint.
.. Change the blueprint name (the name field) to "composer-test-new".
    
    name = "composer-test-new"
    ...output omitted...

.. Add an SSH key for the root user. Use the key shown in this file excerpt.
    
    [[customizations.sshkey]]
    user = "root"
    key = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDGtUW3ismHyuCW4CDdTVOOOq6aySdtYenXFWWx7HJa4VTepkG00aaLId9ocra10hc+MB0GTJMCyabDv3i8NKdi6GDH/aOLVsp/Ewy8DEzZMBlJDCt4v2i4/wU4liw6KgEFkZs+5hnqU8d4QzldyGJ5onr+AGvFOKG68CS0BBl40Z1twf1HhCyx8k6nzD2ovlkxWRFZKPAFrtPCBVvQDkOfVFZF+lwzaSztgAjbFZ4A9jqQyUYx4kOJ5DtRef36ucdUdVQale0+8lICl7/gb142SPpYfhxe88/BJScLPRjvVNeu1TxRmoHtVazqnAoRxQYAn2MoI6AG+w6QuZf8f7aL LabGradingKey"

    Note: 
     If you try to copy/paste from here and meet an error, copy the SSH key from the contents of the file /home/student/.ssh/lab_rsa.pub on the workstation machine.

.. Generate an encrypted password string for the password redhat (enter redhat when prompted).
   
    [student@workstation ~]$ python3 -c "import crypt, getpass; print(crypt.crypt(getpass.getpass(), crypt.METHOD_SHA512))"
    Password:
    $6$.......

... The value of the encrypted string in the preceding output is different on your system.
... Copy the encrypted password string you generated. You use it in the next step for the value of the `password =` field in the `customizations`.user section.

.. Add a new user to the blueprint by adding the following section to the file.
... This section adds the user `user1` with the password `redhat`.
... Paste the copied encrypted password string value from the previous step in the password field within double quotes.
... In the key field, use the SSH key you used for the `root` user in a previous step.

... The user uses the public key of the student user and is part of groups `users` and `wheel`.
    
    [[customizations.user]]
    name = "user1"
    password = "<encrypted password string copied from previous step>"
    key = "<public SSH key for student user>"
    shell = "/usr/bin/bash"
    groups = ["users", "wheel"]
    uid = 1001

. Save and close the file after you make the changes.

. Push this new configuration to image builder:
   
   [student@workstation ~]$ composer-cli blueprints push composer-test-new.toml

. Refresh the RHEL web console and return to the `Image Builder` page. Verify that the new blueprint `composite-test-new` is visible.

. Create a `qemu2` image for the `composer-test-new` blueprint.
.. Click `Create image` button for the `composer-test-new` blueprint.
.. Select the Image output type as QEMU image (`.qcow2`) and then click *Next*.
+

.. Click *Create*.

. Wait for about 5 minutes for the image creation to complete. Check the status from the command line.

   [student@workstation hol001]$ composer-cli compose list

. Install the `libguestfs-tools-c` package as the grading script requires it to evalute your work. Enter the sudo password `student` when prompted.

   [student@workstation ~]$ sudo dnf install -y libguestfs-tools-c
   [sudo] password for student:
   
. Run the grading script to verify your work.

  [student@workstation ~]$ lab grade imagebuilder-customize
  Grading lab.
  SUCCESS Checking lab systems
  ...output omitted...
  Overall lab grade: PASS

  Note: 
    If you run the script too early, the script fails as the image creation is not complete.

. Optionally, download and test the image on the `workstation` machine.
.. Click *Download image* for the image created from the composer-test-new blueprint to download the image.
