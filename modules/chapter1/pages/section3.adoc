== Image builder interfaces

This section introduces the image builder API and the two interfaces available that use that API.

= Image builder API

Image builder is an application programming interface (API) server for building disk images. That means it provides its functionality through API endpoints.

Two front-end tools use this API:

 - Command-line interface (`composer-cli`)
 - Plug-in for the RHEL 9 web console (`cockpit-composer`)

= Image builder CLI

The image builder CLI provides a command-line interface for using image builder. The root command is composer-cli, and you can use the command shown here to output a help page for that command.

 # composer-cli -h


= Image builder plug-in for the RHEL 9 web console

The `cockpit-composer` plug-in provides a GUI for image builder within the RHEL 9 web console. This interface allows using image builder remotely from a web browser interface.

As a web application, the `cockpit-composer` plug-in does not require you to have GUI packages installed on a RHEL 9 system to access it.

The image here shows what the image builder looks like within the web console in RHEL 9.0. This view shows a list of blueprints inside the image builder. Information on blueprints is available later in this course.

 Note: The default port to access the web console is 9090.
