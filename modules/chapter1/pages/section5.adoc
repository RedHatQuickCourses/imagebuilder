== Creating blueprints and images

= Create and customize blueprints via the web console

When an application needs to be added to an infrastructure, you can use image builder to design a single system to deploy that application, and to generate corresponding images.

The feature that holds that customized plan for the system is called a `blueprint`.

A blueprint is a list of preselected components for a system that forms the template for a custom image. Some components are packages or software groups.

You can create multiple images in multiple supported formats from the same blueprint. A blueprint saves a record of the inputs and instructions for an image build so it can be reproduced later.

The screenshot on this page shows what the list of blueprints looks like in the web console interface. The *Image Builder* navigation sidebar option presents an overview.

Click *Create Blueprint* in the image builder interface to open the page shown in the screenshot here.

On this page, you can select components to customize the system. A component can be RPM packages or kernel customizations.

After making your selections, you save the new blueprint. From here, you can edit the blueprint as needed without starting over, including adding and removing components.

*Create images*

After creating a blueprint, you can create images based on that blueprint. The previous section, which show screenshots of viewing and editing a blueprint, show the button for building an image from the selected blueprint.

Image builder allows building any of the supported image types mentioned earlier from a blueprint. The screenshot here shows selecting the output file format for the image you want to build.

= Blueprint customization by using the CLI

To customize a blueprint from the CLI:

. To add a user to the weldr or root groups, run the following commands:
   
   # sudo usermod -a -G weldr <user>
   # newgrp weldr

. Download a copy of the blueprint configuration file from image builder:

   # composer-cli blueprints save <blueprint-name>

. Edit that file using any file editor of your choice. The file name ends with toml extenstion (example: blueprint-name.toml).
 
. Push the revised blueprint configuration file back to image builder:

   # composer-cli blueprints push <blueprint-name.toml>

. Verify that your changes appear in the configuration file using this command:

   # composer-cli blueprints show <blueprint-name>

Blueprint configuration files follow TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) format, which uses key/value pairs. For more information, see TOML on GitHub at https://github.com/toml-lang/toml[Github Toml]

*Adding SSH keys for a user*

Append lines to the blueprint configuration file to add SSH keys for a user.

SSH keys for the root user:
  [
 [customizations.sshkey]]
 user = "root"
 key = "<public SSH key>"

If you copy the contents of your personal public key file (.ssh/id_rsa.pub) to the value of key, you should be able to use SSH to log in as root on systems launched from the resulting image.

*Adding users*

Append lines to the blueprint configuration file to add a new user.

New user `myuser`:

 [[customizations.user]]
 name = "myuser"
 description = <user description>
 password = "<password in plain text OR an encrypted password string>"
 key = "<public SSH key>"
 home = "/home/my-user/"
 shell = "/usr/bin/bash"
 groups = ["users", "wheel"]
 uid = 1001
 gid = 1001

To generate encrypted password string:
 
 # python3 -c "import crypt, getpass; print(crypt.crypt(getpass.getpass(), crypt.METHOD_SHA512))"
